# Getting Started: Notes

* There are lot of complicated ways to transmit data and instructions. Need to rewatch that section and do a Wikipedia deep dive.
* U-shaped jumper cables! Like regular jumper cables, but flat!
* The analogue version of `digitalWrite` is... `analogWrite`!

## Questions

1. How does the LDR actually work? Why do we hook the "positive side" of the LDR to the analogue input?
My guess is that we get a current reading from that part and it changes depending on how much resistance the LDR has, which in turn depends on the ambient light.
But why wouldn't we hook it up at the other end of the LDR when the current has gone through?
